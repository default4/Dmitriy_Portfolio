      <description>Overview The &amp;ldquo;Automatic Character Identification from TV Show Lines&amp;rdquo; project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict which character from a TV show might have spoken a given line. This intricate task of text classification involves numerous steps, from data preprocessing to model optimization.
Goals Text Classification: Develop a model capable of classifying lines from a TV show to their corresponding characters, thereby enabling automatic character identification based on dialogues.</description>

      <description>Goals Understand the distribution of player ratings. Investigate how games typically end (e.g., checkmate, time forfeit). Explore the relationship between player ratings and game outcomes. Identify popular openings and strategies. Dataset The dataset contains following columns:
PGN: Portable Game Notation, which represents the moves made in the chess game. Mode: The type of game, e.g., Classical, Blitz, Bullet, etc. Result: Outcome of the game, e.g., &amp;ldquo;Black Wins&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;White Wins&amp;rdquo;. Average Rating: The average rating of the players in the game.</description>

      <description>This project aims to build a model to detect credit card fraud using a dataset of credit card transactions. Each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
Dataset The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, each represented by 31 columns:
Time: Seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. V1 to V28: PCA transformed features. Amount: The transaction amount. Class: Target variable (1 represents a fraudulent transaction, and 0 represents a non-fraudulent transaction).</description>

      <description>This project aims to build a content-based recommendation system for death metal albums. The recommendation system suggests similar albums based on various features such as the band&amp;rsquo;s country of origin, status, genre, theme, the year the album was released, and the average review score.
Datasets The project utilizes three datasets from:
albums.csv
Contains information about death metal albums, including the album ID, band ID, title, and release year. bands.csv
Provides details about death metal bands, including the band ID, name, country of origin, status, year formed, genre, theme, and active years.</description>
